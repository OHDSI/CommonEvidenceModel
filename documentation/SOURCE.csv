SHERLOCK,"ClinicalTrials.gov publicly makes available information about clinical trials and is maintained by the U.S. National Library of Medicine (NLM) and the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH). Each trial, however, comes as an individual eXtensible Markup Language (XML) file which is difficult for summarizing information across trials. Instead of using the XMLs we leverage a tool called Sherlock which downloads trial information from ClinicalTrials.gov, and then parses and organizes that data for analysis. For more information on Sherlock:  Cepeda, M.S., V. Lobanov, and J.A.
